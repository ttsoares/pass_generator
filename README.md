## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - React framework
- [tailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - For styles
- [JSDoc](https://jsdoc.app/) - Type safe Javascript with automatic documentation
- [zxcvbn](https://www.npmjs.com/package/zxcvbn) - zxcvbn is a password strength estimator inspired by password crackers.
- [react-slider](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-slider) - Accessible, CSS agnostic, slider component for React.

### What I learned

- The input controlled slider was the most difficult part specially because the styling.
- To really apply the JSDoc to its full potential is yet to be achieved...
- Learned to use temporary styling and temporary display of elements.

### Continued development

I would really want some mentoring about the use of JSDoc...
I was unable to make JSDoc the include the file /utils/PassGen.js in the documentation.

### Useful resources

- [JSDoc](https://jsdoc.app/) - JSDoc reference
